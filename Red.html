    Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light,
    next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength
    of approximately 625â€“740 nanometers. [2] It is a primary color in
    the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary
    color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and
    vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink
    to the dark red burgundy. [3] The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh
    scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological
    features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide.
    Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red color
    of blood comes from protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries,
    red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins.
