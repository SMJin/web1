    <p>Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the
      characteristic of human visual perception described through color
      categories, with names such as red, blue, yellow, green, orange,
      or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation
      of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the
      spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of
      color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light
      that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's
      physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.
